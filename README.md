# js1k

## What is this?
This is the very beginning of my compression algorithm repository. I'll be commiting some possible compression algorithms in future. As you can see, name of repository is js1k. JS1K is a javascript code competition. Competitors try to code cool demos under 1kb file size. I like this competition and i named this repository to refers to this competition.

## Motivation
I always wanted to compress javascript libraries like jQuery or Three.js into 1kb. This is kind of passion to me. I study Physics at Istanbul University and because of that i know math well. I know how to use Fourier series on JS, i know how to solve possible trigonametrical problems. And i'll be using these skills to compress these popular libraries on this repository. I'll try to push every successfull steps.

## How?
I'm not sure how. At least for now. But i have some ideas, one of them compressing number sequences with using Fourier series. And i'm also planning to use prime numbers on my compression algorithm.
